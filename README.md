# JSON Parser 
## Overview
This project is a JSON parser implemented in Golang. The parser reads JSON files from the command line and determines whether they are valid JSON or not. It consists of two main components: lexical analysis and syntactic analysis.

### Features
* Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes the JSON file by breaking down the sequence of characters into meaningful tokens.
* Syntactic Analysis: Analyzes the list of tokens to match it to a formal grammar.
* Parser: Takes text as input and builds a data structure that represents the input JSON.
